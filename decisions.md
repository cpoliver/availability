## Your decisions logs

- In production I'd prefer a theme-based UI system like rebass, so I don't have to pass arbitrary css values and instead defer to a design system for things like colors, spacing, common styles
- After being a TypeScript junkie for some time, it felt weird using plain ol' JavaScript. I'd like to use TS if possible, but if not, at least define PropTypes the JS way
- I used some helper libraries that I have found to be tried, tested, and help prevent wheel-reinvention such as ramda, date-fns
- I'd usually strucure my project/app into /common and /feature sub-directories so things are grouped by business function rather than abitrary file types (reducers, components, styles, etc.)
- I would like to have tightened up the eslint config and set up prettier, but due to time restrictions, I decided to focus more on getting the MVP up and running
